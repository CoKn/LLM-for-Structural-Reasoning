Since W is not H accompaniment (because W is the accompaniment of F and M, and H and M do not share accompaniment), X must be H accompaniment. Now, we need to find out which singer G accompanies. We know that X is not G accompaniment (because X is H accompaniment, and X or Y is H accompaniment). We also know that F and G do not share accompaniment. Therefore, G must accompany K. Now, we can conclude that X accompanies H, and G accompanies.",
