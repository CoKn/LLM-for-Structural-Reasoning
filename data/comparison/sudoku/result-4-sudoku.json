  "cot": "Let's analyze the given conditions. We know that the duty arrangement cannot be repeated, and there is exactly one person on duty for two days. We also know that J should be placed on the next day of duty H, and G must be on the same day as one of J and O. Additionally, O must be on the third day, and K must be on at least one day on the first or second day.\n\nFrom condition (2), we know that the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day. This means that the person on duty for two days cannot be O, since O is already on the third day.\n\nFrom condition (3), we know that G must be on the same day as one of J and O. Since O is on the third day, G must be on the same day as J. This means that G and J are on the same day, and G is not on duty for two days.",
