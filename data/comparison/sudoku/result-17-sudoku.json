  "question": "The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of \"friends are like dung\".\nSince the conclusion of \"friends like dung\" is not true, it can be logically derived?\nA.The expression \"money is like dung\" is false.\nB.If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.\nC.The statement that \"friends are valuable\" is true.\nD.The words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false.",

  "cot": "The conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is absurd, so we need to find the logical flaw in the argument. The argument seems to be using a form of analogy, comparing \"money is like dung\" to \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\". The problem is that the analogy is not consistent, as \"money is like dung\" implies that money is worthless, while \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\" implies that friends are valuable. This inconsistency leads to the absurd conclusion \"friends are like dung\".",
