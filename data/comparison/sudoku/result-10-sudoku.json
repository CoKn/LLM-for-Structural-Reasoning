Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time.\n3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that either Guo Yanran or Tang Xiaohua must be selected. Let's assume Guo Yanran is selected. Then, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected, and we have 2 girls and 4 boys left.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time. This means that at least one of them must be selected.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time. Since Tang Xiaohua is not selected, Qiu Zhijie can be selected.",
