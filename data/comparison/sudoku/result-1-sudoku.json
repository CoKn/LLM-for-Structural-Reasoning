  "question": "There are 6 clear flower porcelains? S, Y, M, Q, K, X.The production time of each piece is different.From left to right, the exhibitions are sorted in order from the earliest to the latest.The known sorting conditions are as follows? (1) M is older than X.(2) If Y is earlier than M, then Q is earlier than K and X.(3) If the age of M is earlier than Y, the age of K is earlier than Q and X.(4) The age of S is either earlier than Y or earlier than M, and both have neither.\nWhich of the following lists the possible exhibition order?\nA.Q.M.S, K.Y.X\nB.Q, K.Y, M.X, S\nC.Y.S, M.X.Q, K\nD.M, K, S, Q, Y, X",

The age of S is either earlier than Y or earlier than M, and both have neither.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know M is older than X.\n\nFrom condition 2, if Y is earlier than M, then Q is earlier than K and X. This means that if Y is earlier than M, the order is Y, M, Q, K, X.\n\nFrom condition 3, if M is earlier than Y, then K is earlier than Q and X. This means that if M is earlier than Y, the order is M, K, Q, X.\n\nFrom condition 4, the age of S is either earlier than Y or earlier than M, and both have neither. This means that S can be placed anywhere in the sequence, but it cannot be placed between Y and M.",
