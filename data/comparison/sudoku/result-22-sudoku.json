From condition (3), if K is in a group, J must also be in that group. Since K is in both groups, J must also be in both groups. From condition (4), M is at least one of the members of these two groups, so M must be in either the printing group or the binding group. Since the printing group has exactly three members, M cannot be in the printing group. Therefore, M must be in the binding group.",
