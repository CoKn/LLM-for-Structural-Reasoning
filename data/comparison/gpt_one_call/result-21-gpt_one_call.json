This means that Y is not wearing a red costume. Since S is the sixth athlete to reach the finish line, and Y reached the finish line before S, S must be wearing a green costume. We also know that Z reached the finish line before U, and two athletes who reached the finish line before Y were wearing red costumes. This means that Z is not wearing a red costume, so Z must be wearing a green costume. We have now accounted for three athletes who are wearing green costumes: S, Y, and Z.",
