Condition (2) states that G and H cannot be on duty on the same day. Condition (3) states that if K is on the first day of duty, then G is on the second day of duty. Condition (4) states that if S is on the third day of duty, then H is on the second day of duty. We can start by analyzing the conditions and trying to find a possible arrangement. Try to find a possible arrangement that meets the conditions. Since L and P must be on duty on the same day (Condition 1), we can start by placing them together on one of the three days. Let's try placing them on the first day. This leaves two people, G, H, K, and S, to be assigned to the second and third days.",
