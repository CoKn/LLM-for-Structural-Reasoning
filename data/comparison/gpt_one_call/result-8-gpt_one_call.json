  "cot": "Since each member must be a member of at least one sub-committee, and each sub-committee has 3 members, we can conclude that each member is a member of exactly one sub-committee. Since F is a member of three sub-committees, it must be the case that F is a member of two sub-committees that have only one member in common, and the third sub-committee has the remaining three members. Since H and I are not members of the same sub-committee, they must be in different sub-committees. Therefore, F cannot be in the same sub-committee as H and I. This means that F must be in a sub-committee with G and M, and the other two sub-committees must have H and I, and P respectively.",
