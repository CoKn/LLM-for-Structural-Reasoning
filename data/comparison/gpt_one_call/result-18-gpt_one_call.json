If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know F must be in the production department. From condition 2, G cannot be in the same department as F, so G must be in either the public relations or sales department. From condition 3, if X is in the sales department, W must be in the production department. Since F is already in the production department, W cannot be in the production department, so X must be in the sales department. This means W is in the production department.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining employees: H, I, and Y. From condition 1, H and Y must be in the same department. Since F is in the production department, H and Y cannot be in the production department. Therefore, they must be in either the public relations or sales department. Since X is already in the sales department, H and Y must be in the public relations department",
