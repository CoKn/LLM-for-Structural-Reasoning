Since F is a member of three sub-committees, it must be the case that F is a member of two sub-committees that have only one member in common, and the third sub-committee has the remaining three members. Since H and I are not members of the same sub-committee, they must be in different sub-committees. Therefore, F cannot be in the same sub-committee as H and I. This means that F must be in a sub-committee with G and M, and the other two sub-committees must have H and I, and P respectively.",
