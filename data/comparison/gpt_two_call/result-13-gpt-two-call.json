  "cot": "We need to analyze the given conditions to determine which statements must be true. From condition (1), we know that if statement A is retained, then statements B and C must be retained. From condition (2), we know that if statement E is retained, then statements D and C must be deleted at the same time. From condition (3), we know that statement F can only be retained if statement E is retained. From condition (4), we know that statement A is important information and cannot be deleted. Since we have analyzed the conditions, we can now make some conclusions. We know that statement A is important and cannot be deleted (condition 4). We also know that if statement A is retained, then statements B and C must be retained (condition 1). This means that statements B and C must be retained. \nNow, let's consider the relationship between statements E, D, and C. From condition (2), we know that if statement E is retained, then statements D and C must be deleted at the same time. This means that if statement E is retained, statement C must be deleted. \nFrom condition (3), we know that statement F can only be retained if statement E is retained. This means that if statement F is retained, statement E must also be retained. \nNow, we can conclude that if statement E is retained, then statement C must be deleted, and if statement F is retained, then statement E must be retained. This means that statement E and statement F are related, and we cannot retain one without the other. \n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that if statement E is retained, then statement C must be deleted, and if statement F is retained, then statement E must be retained.",
