  "cot": "Since it is known that (2) wherever Chinese students go, foreign students must go, and (3) where there are foreign students, Chinese students must go, we can conclude that if a Chinese student goes to a destination, a foreign student must also go to the same destination. We are also given that John went to Xi'an or Hangzhou, and Zhao Qiang went to Zhangjiajie. This means that if John went to Xi'an, Zhao Qiang must have gone to Zhangjiajie, and if John went to Hangzhou, Zhao Qiang must have gone to Zhangjiajie. Since Zhang Lin and Li Shan are Chinese students, they cannot both go to Hangzhou if John went to Hangzhou, because Zhao Qiang would have to go to Zhangjiajie, and there would be no foreign students left to go to Hangzhou. Similarly, if John went to Xi'an, Zhang Lin and Li Shan cannot both go to Hangzhou, because Zhao Qiang would have to go to Zhangjiajie, and there would be no Chinese students left to go to Hangzhou. Therefore, Zhang Lin and Li Shan cannot go to Hangzhou at the same time.",
