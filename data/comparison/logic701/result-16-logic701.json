  "cot": "Let's analyze the conditions and the given information. Dr. Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients. Since E, F, and J are males, Dr. Zhang must be responsible for at least one of them. Condition (3) states that if a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Since J and K are children, and E, F, and J are males, Dr. Zhang must be responsible for treating J, and since J is a male, Dr. Zhang must also be responsible for treating an adult male patient. This means Dr. Zhang is responsible for treating either E or F. Among the patients, J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults",
