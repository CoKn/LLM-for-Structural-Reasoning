If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.\n4. Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.\n5. P cannot be in the same team as Q.\n6. If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\n\nWe need to find an acceptable arrangement for the first team's performance, which consists of three positions: front, middle, and back. Let's try to find a possible arrangement for the first team's performance. We can start by considering the conditions one by one.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that if G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front. Let's assume G is in the front.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that if L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1. Since L is not in the front, he must be in the middle or back. Let's assume L is in the middle.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that if K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle. Since L is already in the middle, K cannot be in the middle. Therefore, K must be in the back.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. Since K is in the back, P cannot be in the back. Therefore, P must be in the front or middle. However, P cannot be in the same team as Q, so P cannot be in the same team as L. Therefore, P must be in the front.\n\nFrom condition 6, we know that if H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1. Since G is already in the front, H cannot be in team 1. Therefore, H must be in team 2.\n\nNow we have a possible arrangement for the first team's performance:\n\nFront: G, P\nMiddle: L\nBack: K\n\nPlease proceed to the next step",
