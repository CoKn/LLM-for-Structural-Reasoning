  "cot": "Let's analyze the given information. We know that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent, so they cannot be on the same floor. We also know that the finance department is on the floor above the planning department, and the administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department. This means that the planning department is on a floor that is below the administrative department and the human resources department. Since the human resources department is not on the top floor, the top floor must be occupied by either the research and development department or the sales department. We can eliminate option D because the sales department cannot be on the top floor. We can also eliminate option C because the research and development department cannot be on the floor below the human resources department. This leaves us with options A and B. We can eliminate option B because the research and development department cannot be on the floor below the administrative department. Therefore, the research and development department must be on either floor 3 or floor 4.",
