If J participates, then G participates.\n4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that either E or F will participate, but not both. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If E participates, then F cannot participate (by condition 1). But condition 4 says that unless F participates, M does not participate. So, if E participates, M must participate.\n* If F participates, then E cannot participate (by condition 1). In this case, condition 4 does not apply, and we don't know if M will participate.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that one of J or K will participate, but not both. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If J participates, then G participates (by condition 3). In this case, K cannot participate (by condition 2).\n* If K participates, then J cannot participate (by condition 2). We don't know if G will participate.\n\nNow, let's combine the possibilities:\n\n* If E participates, then M participates, and J or K participates (but not both).\n* If F participates, then J or K participates (but not both), and we don't know if M participates.",
