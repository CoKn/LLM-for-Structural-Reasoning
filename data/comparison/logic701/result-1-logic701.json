The age of S is either earlier than Y or earlier than M, and both have neither.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know M is older than X.\n\nFrom condition 2, if Y is earlier than M, then Q is earlier than K and X. This means that if Y is earlier than M, the order is Y, M, Q, K, X.\n\nFrom condition 3, if M is earlier than Y, then K is earlier than Q and X. This means that if M is earlier than Y, the order is M, K, Q, X.\n\nFrom condition 4, the age of S is either earlier than Y or earlier than M, and both have neither.
