If Carl were on Project X, then Brenda would be on Project X (from rule 4), but we just established Brenda must be on Project Y. Therefore, Carl cannot be on Project X → Carl must be on Project Y. From rule 1, if Alan is on Project X, then Carl must be on Project Y — which is satisfied. But nothing forces Alan to be on X or Y.
