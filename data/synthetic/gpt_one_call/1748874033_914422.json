The constraints are: 1) If P is in league 1, then Q must be in league 2. 2) R and S must be assigned to different leagues. 3) If T is in league 2, then U must be in league 1. 4) V cannot be in the same league as U. Question: If R is in league 1, which of the following must be true? a) P is in league 1. b) S is in league 2. c) T is in league 1. d) U is in league 2.",
