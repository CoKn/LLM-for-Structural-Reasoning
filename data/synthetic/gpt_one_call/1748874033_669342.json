  "question": "There are five students: A, B, C, D, and E who must be assigned to one of two study groups, X or Y. The following conditions apply: 1) If A is in group X, then B must be in group Y. 2) C and D must be in different groups. 3) If E is in group Y, then C must also be in group Y. 4) A and D cannot be in the same group. Question: If C is in group X, which of the following must be true? a) A is in group X. b) B is in group Y. c) E is in group Y. d) D is in group Y.",

  "answer": "d",
  "cot": "Given C is in group X, D must be in group Y (Rule 2). Since A and D cannot be in the same group (Rule 4), A must be in group X. Rule 1 does not force a contradiction here since it would need A to be in group X and B in group Y, which does not conflict with the given scenario. Rule 3 does not apply since E's position is not constrained directly. Therefore, D in group Y is what must be true.",
