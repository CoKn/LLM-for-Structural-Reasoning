  "question": "Five employees, A, B, C, D, and E, are each assigned to work on one of two projects: Project X or Project Y. The following conditions apply: 1. If A is assigned to Project X, then B must be assigned to Project Y. 2. Either A or C must be assigned to Project X, but not both. 3. If D is assigned to Project Y, then B must be assigned to Project X. 4. E must be assigned to a different project than C. 5. If B is assigned to Project Y, then D must also be assigned to Project Y. Given that D is assigned to Project X, which of the following must be true? (A) C is assigned to Project X. (B) A is assigned to Project Y. (C) E is assigned to Project Y. (D) B is assigned to Project X.",

  "cot": "Since D is assigned to Project X, the condition 'If D is assigned to Project Y, then B must be assigned to Project X' doesn't apply. According to condition 5, if B were assigned to Project Y, then D would also need to be assigned to Project Y, contradicting the fact that D is on Project X. Therefore, B cannot be assigned to Project Y, so B must be assigned to Project X. With B on Project X, condition 1 implies A cannot be on Project X because that would necessitate B being on Project Y, which we have already determined is impossible. Therefore, A must be assigned to Project Y. Now looking at condition 2, since A is not assigned to Project X, C must be, as exactly one of them must be assigned to Project X. Finally, from condition 4, since C is on Project X, E must be on Project Y. The configuration respects all conditions and does not lead to contradictions. Therefore, answer choice (B) 'A is assigned to Project Y' must be true.",
