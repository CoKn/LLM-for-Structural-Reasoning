  "cot": "Let's analyze the scenario where C is on Team Y. According to Constraint 2, C and D cannot be on the same team. Thus, since C is on Team Y, D must be on Team X. The other constraints need to be checked to ensure consistency with this configuration:\n\n1. Constraint 1 doesn't directly apply here, as we don't have information on A's team choice based on C being on Team Y.\n\n2. Constraint 3 doesn't provide any information in this context without knowing E's team.\n\n3. Constraint 4 indicates B and E must be on different teams, but without specific info, we can't narrow down further in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true given that C is on Team Y is that D must be on Team X.",
