The following conditions are given: 1) If G goes to the Beach, then J must go to the Mountain. 2) H and K must be in the same group. 3) If L goes to the Mountain, M must join G. 4) J and K must be in different groups. 5) I cannot be in the same group as G.

  "cot": "Since J is on the Mountain, G must be on the Beach (from Constraint 1 which links G\u2019s Beach position to J being separately on the Mountain). Given Constraint 5, I can\u2019t be in the same group as G, implying that I must be on the Beach as well.\n\nLet's verify additional constraints:\n- Constraint 2: H and K have to align; however, the placement is not known unless further data provided.\n- Constraint 3 with L could affect M via G only if more placements were specified.\n- Constraint 4 separates K and J, which is inherently true since J is on the Mountain.\n\nTherefore, with the consistent chain logic, while others are possible configurations, \"B) I is on the Beach\" is a consequent step required from J being on the Mountain.",
