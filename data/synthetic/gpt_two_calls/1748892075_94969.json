  "cot": "To solve this puzzle, we need to examine each condition and evaluate the given options. Start by considering the implications of the rules. \n1. From condition (1), if F is in Box X, G must be there too, but this does not necessitate G being in Box X unless F is there. Thus A isn't a definite truth.\n2. Condition (2) prevents H and I from sharing a box. Either H is in X and I in Y, or vice versa. But neither placement is definite.\n3. From condition (3), J and K must be in the same box, but that doesn't require K to be explicitly in Box Y unless J is determined to be there, which isn't certain without more context.\n4. Condition (4) ensures if I is in Box Y, F must also be in Box Y. This fact logically prevents J and F from being in the same box if I is indeed put in Box Y since J and K must be together and either could go to X.\nThus, based on conditions 3 and 4, D is logically sound, as J and F can't share the same box if F is dictated by whether I is in Box Y and J is linked to K, which could be the opposite of F.",
