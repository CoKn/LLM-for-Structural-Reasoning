  "cot": "First, we begin by assuming A is in Room 1. Due to condition 1, B must be in Room 2. Condition 4 then puts C in Room 1 because B is in Room 2. Since C and D must be in the same room (condition 2), D is also in Room 1. However, condition 3 says E cannot be in Room 1 because A is there. Therefore, E must be in Room 2. With this setup, A and C are in different rooms (Room 1 for A and Room 2 for C), satisfying option A. Verifying other scenarios and conditions leads to similar allocations which always prevent A and C from being in the same room under these logical constraints.",
