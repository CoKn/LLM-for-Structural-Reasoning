  "question": "There are five students: A, B, C, D, and E. Each student must be assigned to either Team X or Team Y. The following constraints apply: (1) If A is on Team X, then B must also be on Team X. (2) C and D must be on different teams. (3) If E is on Team Y, then C must be on Team X. (4) A cannot be on the same team as D. Given these conditions, if C is on Team Y, which of the following must be true? (a) A is on Team Y. (b) B is on Team X. (c) E is on Team X. (d) D is on Team X.",
