  "question": "Five students, A, B, C, D, and E, are each going on a school trip to one of two locations: the zoo or the aquarium. The following conditions apply: 1) If A goes to the zoo, then B must go to the aquarium. 2) C and D go to different locations. 3) If E goes to the aquarium, then D must also go to the aquarium. 4) A and C must go to the same location. Question: If B goes to the zoo, which of the following must be true? a) A goes to the aquarium b) D goes to the zoo c) C goes to the zoo d) E goes to the aquarium",

  "cot": "1. If B goes to the zoo, then by condition 1, A must go to the aquarium, because if A goes to the zoo, B must go to the aquarium, which contradicts B going to zoo. 2. If A goes to the aquarium, by condition 4, C must also go to the aquarium. 3. Applying condition 2, since C goes to the aquarium, D must go to the zoo (as C and D go to different locations). 4. There are no specific conditions for E with the given information and E's location could be either zoo or aquarium. Thus, the only necessary conclusion is that A goes to the aquarium.",
