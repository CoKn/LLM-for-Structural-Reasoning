  "cot": "Since B is attending the Music Fest, from Condition 1, A cannot be attending the Music Fest; otherwise, B must be at the Art Show. Therefore, A must attend the Art Show. C being at the Music Fest (Condition 4) implies D must be at the Art Show (Condition 2). If E attends the Art Show, A must also attend the Art Show (Condition 3), which is consistent with our current requirement that A is in the Art Show.",
