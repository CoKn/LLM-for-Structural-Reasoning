  "question": "Seven employees, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, are divided into two teams: X and Y. The division must satisfy the following conditions: 1) If A is on team X, then B must be on team Y. 2) C and D cannot be on the same team. 3) If F is on team Y, then E must be on team X. 4) Either G or B must be on team X, but not both.
