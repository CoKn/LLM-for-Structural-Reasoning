However, if A goes to Sports, there are no restrictions on B's choice. Condition 2 indicates that one of C or D has to be in Sports but not both.

Given B is in department Y, condition 1 becomes void for A's placement but ensures E remains in X. Condition 1 doesn\u2019t affect us currently since we deduced B's placement through another reasoning.

    "cot": "We need to determine what must be true if C goes on the mountain climb. Firstly, if C goes on the mountain climb, the condition related to C being on the desert trek is irrelevant (condition 2 does not apply). This means D's placement is not affected by C but must be determined by other conditions. Condition 3 states E cannot be on the same expedition as D, so if D were on the mountain climb, E would need to be on the desert trek. However, there is no condition forcing D to be on the mountain climb. Condition 4 requires either A or C (or both) to be on the mountain climb. Since C is already on the mountain climb, this condition is satisfied regardless of A's placement. Therefore, A's expedition choice is not determined by C\u2019s placement. Based on this analysis, no conditions absolutely determine the placement of A, B, D, or E in direct relation to C being on the mountain climb aside from the already satisfied mountain climb condition for either A or C. Thus, no other expedition placements are strictly necessary other than the requirements already satisfied (i.e., A or C on mountain climb fulfilled by C). Among the options given, the necessary placement of E follows from the inability to accompany D (should any conditions not place D and E together, choosing E ensures separation), but no other constraints force this solution as strictly necessary. To clarify: Option B where 'E goes on the desert trek' is closest to a necessary consequence due to the conditions involved as analyzing their placements further in context with D following other paths, this placement aligns with restrictions, though not absolute from C\u2019s sole mountain placement.

Looking at condition 2, C and D must go to different destinations. If B is not to go to the same destination as C (Condition 4), we need to consider where C could go. Since A is free to go anywhere due to E being at the mountains and not triggering the condition involving A and B directly yet, we proceed by checking pairs: Assume A goes to the mountains; we must place C at the beach to ensure diversity with D (Condition 3), placing D at the mountains. However, this forces B at the mountains making it conflict with condition 4 'B cannot go to the same destination as C', as C is at the beach. Hence, A faces a contradiction assuming mountains, suggesting B is more aligned to go to a singular destination without conflict, namely the mountains without contradicting 4. Let's assume: E at mountains, C at beach from the start; simplifies B must be at mountains, as D diversifies with C (possible freedom due to inactive E\u2013beach scenario).

If B is in Development, then E cannot be in Development. (If B = Development, E \u2260 Development)\n3. If D is in Research, B must also be in Research. (If D = Research, B = Research)\n4. C and D cannot be in the same department. \n\nNow, we need to check which statement must always be true.\n- Statement A) A is in Development: This is not necessarily true, as A can be in Research.\n- Statement B) B and C are in different departments: Let's test this. If B were in the same department as C, let's say, in Development, there\u2019s no direct contradiction. However, due to condition 4 and potential interactions with others (A could force C into Development, making B need to split departments due to C), this seems often enforceable, but we need further investigation.\n- Statement C) D is in Development: If D were in Research, C cannot be there (condition 4), hence Development is viable but not forced as necessarily true.\n- Statement D) E is in Research: E can be in Development as long as B is not in Development, so this isn't enforced as true.\n\nTesting B and C being different in every scenario and essentially no max dependency constraints forcing C into the same sides as B, B indeed has to maintain a division.\n\nTherefore, statement B) B and C are in different departments is always true based on the given conditions.",
