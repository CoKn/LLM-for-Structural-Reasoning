However, if R is in Container 1, then by Constraint 4, P cannot be in Container 2, creating a contradiction with Constraint 1 that requires Q to be in Container 2 only if P is in Container 1.\n\nHence, if R is indeed in Container 1, Q cannot be in Container 2 (and vice versa). Therefore, keeping S in Container 1 and Q in Container 2 leads to a contradiction if other conditions don't resolve. Therefore, the statement \"A) Q is in Container 2\" must be false when S is in Container 1.",
