The following conditions apply: 1) If A attends in-person, then B must attend virtually. 2) C cannot attend in-person if A attends in-person. 3) If D attends virtually, then E must also attend virtually. 4) A and E cannot both attend in the same manner. Which one of the following must be true? a) B attends in-person. b) C attends virtually. c) D attends in-person. d) E attends virtually.",

Additionally, A and E cannot both attend in the same manner (condition 4), therefore, if A attends in-person or virtually, E must be opposite. Since D attending virtually forces E to attend virtually, and no conditions explicitly require D to attend in-person, E attending virtually is a necessity under multiple scenarios.",
