  "question": "Five employees, A, B, C, D, and E, must be assigned to work on one of two projects: Project X or Project Y. The following conditions apply: 1) If A is assigned to Project X, then B must be assigned to Project Y. 2) C and D must be assigned to the same project. 3) E cannot be assigned to Project Y if B is assigned to Project Y. 4) If D is assigned to Project X, then A cannot be assigned to the same project. In the scenario where A is assigned to Project Y, what must be true? A) B is assigned to Project Y. B) C is assigned to Project X. C) D is assigned to Project Y. D) E is assigned to Project X.",

  "cot": "When A is assigned to Project Y, we analyze the constraints. Constraint 1 doesn't apply because it involves A being in Project X. Constraint 2 mandates C and D must be on the same project. Constraint 3 involves E being on Y only if B is not on Y \u2014 irrelevant unless B's assignment is known. Constraint 4 doesn't apply since it's based on D's assignment to X affecting A. We have freedom with B's assignment because Constraint 1 doesn't bind B to a project when A is on Y. When A is on Y, B can be on either project, allowing flexibility. With C and D tied to the same project, they can both be on X or Y. However, if E is on Y with B, it breaches Constraint 3. Therefore, E must be on X to avoid conflict if B happens to be on Y, making Option D (E on X) the necessary truth.",
