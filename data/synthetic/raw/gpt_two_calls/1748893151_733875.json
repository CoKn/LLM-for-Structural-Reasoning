  "cot": "We start by analyzing the given constraints. 1) If A travels to France, then B goes to Germany. Assume A travels to France, B must travel to Germany. 2) C and D cannot both go to France, so at least one must go to Germany. 3) If D travels to Germany, E must go to France. Therefore, if D is in Germany, E is in France. 4) B and E must travel to different countries. If B is in Germany, E must be in France or vice versa. Given these constraints, B must travel to Germany due to Constraint 1 and possibly D due to Constraint 2, but E could also influence D's travel choice due to Constraint 4.",
