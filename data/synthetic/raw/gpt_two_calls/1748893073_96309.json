  "question": "Six plants, P, Q, R, S, T, and U, need to be placed in two types of gardens: a flower garden or a vegetable garden. They must be arranged according to the following rules: 1) If P is in the flower garden, then Q must be in the vegetable garden. 2) S and T cannot be in the same type of garden. 3) If U is in the flower garden, then T must be in the vegetable garden. 4) Either R or Q must be in the flower garden, but not both. If P is placed in the flower garden, which plant must be in the vegetable garden? (a) S (b) R (c) T (d) Q",

  "answer": "(d) Q",
  "cot": "If P is placed in the flower garden, by rule 1, Q must be in the vegetable garden. Rule 4 indicates either R or Q must be in the flower garden, but not both, which means R likely stays in the flower garden. However, given P's placement and necessary garden inclusion, Q's involvement in vegetable garden aligns the requirements. Rules exclude S and T jointly in placement matters but here Q direct from rule 1 satisfies a placement.",
