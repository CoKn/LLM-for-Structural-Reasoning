  "cot": "Given that D is attending the afternoon session, condition 3 states that A must attend the morning session. Since A is attending the morning session, condition 1 does not automatically apply here. However, condition 2 requires that B and D attend different sessions, meaning B must attend the morning. Condition 4 indicates that E will attend the same session as B, so E must also attend the morning session. This leaves open the possibility for C to attend either session, fulfilling all given conditions. Therefore, the statement that must be true is B) A attends the morning session.",
