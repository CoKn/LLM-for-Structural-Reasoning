  "question": "Six friends \u2014 A, B, C, D, E, and F \u2014 are deciding whether they should participate in either Art or Science club. The following conditions apply: 1) If A joins Art, then B must join Science. 2) If C joins Science, then D must join Science. 3) Either E or F, but not both, must join Art. 4) If D joins Art, then E must join Science. Given this scenario, which of the following must be true: A) C joins Art. B) E joins Art. C) F joins Science. D) B joins Art.",

  "cot": "First, evaluate condition 3, which states either E or F, but not both, must join Art. Therefore, at least one of them must be in Science. Also, consider condition 4 that says if D joins Art, then E must join Science. If E were to be in Art, then this would enforce F in Science due to exclusive choice in condition 3. Since we are focusing on what must be necessarily true in all scenarios, the participation of F in Science is universally consistent. Thus, 'C) F joins Science' must be true under all conditions.",
