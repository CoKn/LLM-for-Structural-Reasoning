  "answer": "C",
  "cot": "Let's examine what happens if C studies French under the given conditions:\n1. Since C studies French, according to Condition 2, D must study a different language, which is Spanish.\n2. Checking Condition 3, if E studies Spanish, then A studies the same language as C, which is French (given C studies French) but we have no immediate need to apply this condition since it depends on what language E chooses.\n3. Checking Condition 4, D cannot study French if A studies Spanish. Since D is confirmed to study Spanish, this condition does not apply right now.\n4. Therefore, with the given C studies French, the direct implication that must be true is that D studies Spanish.",
