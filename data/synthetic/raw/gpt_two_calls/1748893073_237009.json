  "question": "Five students, A, B, C, D, and E, must each participate in one of two workshops: Art or Science. The assignments are subject to the following conditions: 1) If A attends the Art workshop, then B must attend the Science workshop. 2) Either C or D must attend the Art workshop, but not both. 3) If E attends the Science workshop, then D must attend the Art workshop. 4) B and C cannot attend the same workshop. Given that A attends the Art workshop, which student must attend the Science workshop? (a) C (b) D (c) E (d) A",

  "answer": "(a) C",
  "cot": "Given that A attends the Art workshop, B must attend the Science workshop. Since either C or D must attend the Art workshop, and B and C cannot attend the same workshop, C must attend the Art workshop. D must, therefore, attend the Science workshop. However, since the answer requires identifying a single student who must attend Science, any check shows that D attending Science also satisfies B being on Science as they cannot be on the same side as A, indicating C's attendance holds the constraints 'B and C cannot attend the same workshop'. Therefore, C is in Art, only allowing D for Science in all scenarios.",
