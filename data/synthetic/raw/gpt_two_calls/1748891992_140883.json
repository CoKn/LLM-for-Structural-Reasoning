  "answer": "B) B plays Soccer",
  "cot": "To determine which condition must be true, let's analyze the constraints:\n1. If A plays Basketball, then B must play Soccer.\n   - This doesn't exclude the possibility of A playing Soccer, so it doesn't guarantee that A playing Basketball must be true.\n2. D cannot play the same sport as C. \n   - This introduces a dependency between D and C, but no definitive conclusion about either of their sports without further information.\n3. If B plays Basketball, then E must play Basketball.\n   - Again, it introduces a dependency, but no necessity for B's choice by itself.\n4. Either C or E plays Soccer, but not both.\n   - This means one and only one of C or E must play Soccer, but it does not directly lead to knowing who plays which except they can't both play Soccer or both play Basketball.\n\nEvaluating options:\nA) A plays Basketball - This is not a must be true since A could play Soccer.\nB) B plays Soccer - If B does not play Soccer and plays Basketball, then E must play Basketball, conflicting with condition 4, where either C or E must play Soccer but not both.\nC) C plays Basketball - Possible, but not necessarily true due to available conditions.\nD) D plays Soccer - Possible, but not necessarily true.\n\nBased on the above, the clearest condition that must hold is B) B plays Soccer; if B were to play Basketball, it would violate the exclusive condition about Soccer between C and E.\n",
