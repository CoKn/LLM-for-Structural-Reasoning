The conditions are: 1) If L is in room 1, then M must be in room 2. 2) N and O must be in different rooms. 3) If P is in room 2, then N must also be in room 2. 4) O and P cannot be in room 1 together. Question: If N is in room 1, which of the following must be true? a) L is in room 1. b) M is in room 2. c) P is in room 1. d) O is in room 2.",

  "cot": "Given N is in room 1, O must be in room 2 (Rule 2). Rule 4 does not apply since it requires both O and P to be in the same room. If P were in room 2, Rule 3 would be violated as N is confirmed in room 1. So, P must be in room 1. None of the constraints force L or M's placement based on the given scenario. Thus, O being in room 2 is the valid deduction.",
