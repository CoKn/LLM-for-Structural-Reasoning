  "question": "Five animals: Lion (L), Tiger (T), Bear (B), Elephant (E), and Monkey (M) are split into enclosures A and B. The conditions are: 1) If L is in enclosure A, T must be in enclosure B. 2) B and E cannot be in the same enclosure. 3) If M is in enclosure B, then L must also be in enclosure B. 4) T and M cannot be in enclosure A together. Question: If B is in enclosure A, what must be true? a) L is in enclosure A. b) E is in enclosure B. c) M is in enclosure A. d) T is in enclosure B.",
