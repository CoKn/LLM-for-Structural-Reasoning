Question: If K is at party A, what must be true? a) I is at party A. b) G is at party B. c) J is at party B. d) F is at party A.",

  "cot": "Given K is at party A, Rule 4 ensures F cannot be at party B, which does not fix F's position. Rule 3 cannot be applied if G and I are not at the same party as K in its current position doesn't violate Rule 3. If K is at A, G must be at B since having G at A requires H at B (Rule 1). Thus, G at B avoids any logical conflict under Rule 3. Hence, G must be at party B.",
