This means that for every rotation of Gear A, Gear B rotates 3/2 times. To make the last gear in the train rotate 3 times as fast as Gear A, the last gear should rotate 3 * (3/2) = 4.5 times for every rotation of Gear B. Gear C would make the final gear rotate 8/15 of a rotation for each rotation of B, which isn't enough. However, using Gear D, we get Speed_B/Speed_D = Teeth_D/Teeth_B = 72/32 = 9/4. Hence, for each rotation of B, gear D rotates 4/9 of a rotation.
