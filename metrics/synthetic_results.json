The assignments must satisfy the following conditions:\n(1) If Alan is on Project X, then Carl is on Project Y.\n(2) Brenda and Dana are not on the same project.\n(3) Ethan must be on Project Y.\n(4) If Carl is on Project X, then Brenda is on Project X.\n(5) Dana is not on Project Y.\nWhich of the following must be true?\nA.

If Carl were on Project X, then Brenda would be on Project X (from rule 4), but we just established Brenda must be on Project Y. Therefore, Carl cannot be on Project X → Carl must be on Project Y. From rule 1, if Alan is on Project X, then Carl must be on Project Y — which is satisfied. But nothing forces Alan to be on X or Y.
