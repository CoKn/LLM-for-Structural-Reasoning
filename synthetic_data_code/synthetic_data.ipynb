    "   - For each variable, if the domain (the list of possible values) is explicitly defined in the puzzle, use that; otherwise, infer a default domain based on context.\n",
    "     For example, if the puzzle involves countries and mentions \"United Kingdom\" and \"United States\", use the domain `[\"UK\", \"US\"]`.\n",
    "2. **Constraints:**\n",
    "   - Convert each condition statement into a constraint expression.\n",
    "   - Use a Python logical expression format that can be passed to the python‑constraint package.\n",
    "   - Reference variables exactly as they appear.\n",
    "   - For example, given the statement:\n",
    "     \"If G goes to the UK, then H goes to the United States.\"\n",
    "     a possible constraint expression is:\n",
    "     `\"G != 'UK' or H == 'US'\"`\n",
    "     and the corresponding constraint object should include the variable names `[\"G\", \"H\"]`.\n",
    "3. **Output:**\n",
    "   - Do not include any additional text or explanation; output only the JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the puzzle description is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There are 7 outstanding students G, H, L, M, U, W and Z in a school. During the summer vacation, the school will send them to the United Kingdom and the United States for inspection.
